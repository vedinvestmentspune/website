**Mission Statement**

Many people save, but few truly invest — and even fewer know the range of opportunities available to them. At Ved Investments, our mission is to create awareness about the diverse avenues for wealth creation and the importance of aligning investments with one’s personal risk appetite. We start by uncovering the hidden costs of financial inaction and the dangers of uninformed choices. Then, through simple education and transparent guidance, we help individuals choose strategies—from safe to growth-focused—that match their goals, timelines, and comfort with risk. Our purpose is to replace uncertainty with confidence, and missed chances with smart, goal-driven action.

**Vision Statement**

To scale Ved Investments into every corner of India, becoming the most trusted household name for mutual fund advisory and financial literacy—synonymous with transparency, reliability, and results.

We want to create national financial ecosystem that empowers women, irrespective of income or education to take control of their finances, enabling financial freedom.

**About Us**

Ved Investments is a women-led mutual fund advisory and financial literacy firm built on three generations of expertise and trust. Based in Pune, we combine professional financial acumen with a social mission—making wealth creation accessible to every household.

Our team provides end-to-end investment solutions, guiding clients through mutual funds, savings strategies, and personalized financial planning. What sets us apart is our dual focus:

* **Wealth Management:** Helping first time women investors, families, and enterprises grow their wealth through disciplined, research-driven investment strategies.  
* **Social Impact:** Through our *Sakhi* initiative, we extend financial literacy and inclusion to underserved communities—our dedicated social wing that helps households take their first steps into formal finance and transform savings into long-term security.

At Ved, we believe financial independence is more than numbers—it is dignity, confidence, and freedom. By blending professional expertise with a human touch, we are building India’s go-to women-led financial ecosystem, where growth and inclusion go hand in hand.

**Motivation**

I joined Ved Investments after seeing a **clear gap** in the financial advisory space — no one was catering to homemakers, wives, and everyday earners in India, even though many of them have income from gifts, small businesses, or savings. Most mutual fund distributors target high-net-worth individuals, leaving the mid and low-income groups without guidance. These are people who often lack formal financial knowledge and miss out on opportunities to grow their wealth. I chose to focus on the masses, not just the rich, because I believe that financial empowerment should not be a privilege — it should be accessible to everyone.

**Idea written down in GTKY:**

You saw that your mom and grandmom had a degree yet they were financially dependant because women also have to take care of the household and kids. So , the realization was – that even with a small amount of savings , which every women has in India, you can  be financially independent if you know how to grow your money smartly. In India, ,my mom invest in gold jewellery which have less liquidity, has high theft chances and high making costs. While women are wise in money management but financial literacy education is missing. Not taught in schools or colleges.
