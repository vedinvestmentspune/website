**Sakhi – Our Social Impact Wing**

At Ved Investments, *Sakhi* represents our commitment to financial inclusion at the grassroots level. While our Wealth Management practice empowers first-time women investors, Sakhi goes one step further—it is our dedicated social wing, focused on bringing underserved communities into the fold of formal finance.

We believe financial literacy is the first step toward dignity and independence. Many domestic workers continue to rely on informal savings like furniture, jewelry, gold or land. Sakhi works to change this by providing simple, practical guidance and access to trusted financial tools.

**Success Story**

When we first met her, she was a hardworking mother earning just enough to make ends meet. Like many women around her, she believed gold and land were the only safe ways to save. Banks felt intimidating, full of paperwork, rules, and people who spoke a different financial language. So when the time came to pay her children’s school fees, she found herself with assets she couldn’t use and money she couldn’t access.

That’s when Sakhi stepped in. Instead of handing her a lecture on finance, we sat with her over cups of chai and explained banking in the language she was most comfortable with. We drew simple diagrams to show how deposits work, walked with her to open her very first account, and celebrated her first ATM withdrawal like it was a festival.

The change was remarkable. For the first time, she began saving regularly—small amounts, but consistent. Within a year, she had built enough to pay for her children’s education without borrowing a single rupee. What touched us most was what came next: she became the voice of confidence for other women in her community. Inspired by her courage, 20 new accounts were opened, and a dozen women started their own investment journeys.

Her journey is proof of what Sakhi stands for—removing fear, building trust, and showing women that financial independence is within their reach.
